# Signal Viewer
This is a desktop GUI for viewing edf signal files and providing basic controls for playing, pausing, scrolling, zooming and saving pdf reports for the uploaded signals alongside spectrograms.

Multiple signals can be viewed simultaneously by uploading an edf file, then the GUI automatically syncs the plots.

# Setup

1. From the command line create a virtual environment and activate.
```
> python -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies.
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app.
```
> python app.py
```

There is a sample file in the repo *SampleECG.edf* for trying out.
